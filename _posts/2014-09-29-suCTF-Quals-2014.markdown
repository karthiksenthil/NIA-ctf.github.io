## What is this? (20 points)
This was a pretty simple question. Use [StegSolve](http://www.caesum.com/handbook/Stegsolve.jar) to open up one of the images and then merge it with the other image (equivalent to XORing the pixels of the two images).

```
java -jar <link to StegSolve.jar>
```

## Rolling Hashes (40 points)
A question based on reversing a hashing function. On further analysis of the given python code we were able to identify that the mod value(10^30) was not critical in reversing the function(as max value would be below that always). Also the flag is given to be 9 characters long.

After this writing a simple python code to reverse the function was easy.
